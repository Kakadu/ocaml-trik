Demo for testing threads and custom bytecode runtime

run `make hello.byte hello.native` to compile with Qt4
run `QTMODULES=Qt5Widgets make hello.byte helo.native` to compile with Qt5


Issue:
It seems when we do caml_enter_blocking_section in bytecode runtime OCaml threads doesn't
get execution time
With native code everything is fine

N.B. There are some crashes in native code version. I have experienced this in some versions of Qt,
on other ones everything is OK. Don't know for sure what does it mean.
